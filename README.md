# BTP-Phase-1
This repository contains all the research conducted so far in developing and understanding RL algorithms for mechanical systems (not limited) and tradeoffs in real world. Target for phase 1 is learning and early stage research for setting the stage for discovery of a novel algorithm (if possible). Guide: Dr. Shyamnta Hazarika
